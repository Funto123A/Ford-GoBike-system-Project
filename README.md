#  Ford GoBike System Data

## by Funto Adedeji


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

The data sets classified riders into two types, Subscribers and Customers. From the exploration carried out, i found out that there are more male riders than female riders and most of these riders are Suscribers while few are customers.

Subscribers are the constant riders and according the exploration, they make short/quick trips especially on weekdays during rush hours (8am -9am and 5pm-6pm) which might be for work or school runs. While Customers are occassional riders who use the bike sharing system mainly on weekends and are seen to spend longer time on trips compared to Suscribers. This can be probably for city tour or leisure.

I also discovered that Riders above 60 years are seen to make the shortest trip compared to riders below 60 years. And out of the few riders who make longer trips, male riders are observed to be the highest.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, i focus on the user types of the riders (Suscribers and customers). 

I start by checking the distribution of the riders by their user types and which age category of riders make use of the bike sharing system the most.

Also i check the relationship between rider's age of both user types and their trip duration(min) showing by gender through a scatter plot showing the trip duration by gender for both user types.

Afterwards, i check the day(s) of the week riders make either short and long trips. Then i went further to see which of the week days records the highest usage.
